    <h3>Five Reasons Why You Should Donate Blood</h3> 
<p>1. Development of new red blood cells
Within the first 48 hours of blood donation, the donor's body starts replenishing the lost red blood cells. The replenishment process helps in staying healthy and productive at work.

2. Reducing risk of heart disease
As per several studies and reports, when there is a rise in the iron level in blood, it raises the chances of heart diseases. People should donate blood from time to time in order to reduce the iron level in the blood.

3. Burns calories
Donating blood can burn approximately 650 calories for each pint that is like 450 ml of blood.

4. Free blood test
On donating blood, the donor receives a free mini health screening and blood tests.

5. How often can one donate blood?
The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months. This gap helps blood regain the normal haemoglobin count.</p><br>

<h3>Blood donation types<br>The most common forms of blood donations are:</h3><p>
    
Platelets (known as plateletpheresis) – The red cells and plasma are similarly delivered to the donor licensing donation.
Blood – Plasma, red and white blood cells, platelets, antibodies, as well as other elements are included in normal donations.
Plasma (known as apheresis) – During the transfusion, a specific machine separates the plasma from the other elements, and the red blood cells are restored to the donor in cycles.<br>

<h2>Why Does India Require So Much Blood</h2><p>Patients may need a blood transfusion if they have anaemia, sickle cell disease, a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia, or cancer. A cancer patient, on an average, needs at least 100 units of blood. India relies heavily on transfusions due to a higher prevalence of blood-borne diseases and complications during pregnancy. About 60 million trauma induced surgeries are performed in the country every year. It is a witness to more than 1,200 road crashes every day.

    The 230 million major operations, 331 million cancer-related procedures like chemotherapy and 10 million pregnancy complications require blood transfusion.
    
    A culture of voluntary blood donation remains a distant dream in India – predominantly because of the misconceptions, misinformation and ignorance about the effect and safety of blood donation.<br>

"Every day 12,000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood. India collects 11 million units of blood but needs 15 million units, so there’s a deficit of 4 million units. Over 40 districts in India don’t have a single blood bank.
<h2>40% road accident victims in 2018 died due to excessive loss ..
